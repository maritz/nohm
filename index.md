### Overview
Nohm is an [ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping "Object-relational Mapping") for [redis](http://www.redis.io).  
This How-To is intended to give you a good understanding of how nohm works. 

### Basics
There are some things you need to do before you can use nohm. If you just want to know how to actually use nohm models, skip to the next part [Models](#models).

**Note:** Almost all code examples here assume the following code: 
{% highlight js %}
  var nohm = require('nohm').Nohm;
  var redisClient = require('redis').createClient();
  nohm.setClient(redisClient);
{% endhighlight %}

#### Prefix
The first thing you should do is set a prefix for the redis keys. This should be unique on the redis database you're using since you may run into conflicts otherwise.
You can do this with the following command:
{% highlight js %}
  nohm.setPrefix('yourAppPrefixForRedis');
{% endhighlight %}

(Note that you probably shouldn't select such a long prefix since that adds overhead to the redis communication.)

#### Client
You need to set a redis client for nohm. You should connect and select the appropriate database before you set it.

{% highlight js %}
  var redisClient = require('redis').createClient();
  redisClient.select(4); // or something
  nohm.setClient(redisClient);
{% endhighlight %}

#### Logging
By default nohm just logs errors it encounters to the console. However you can overwrite the logError method with anything you want:

{% highlight js %}
  // this will throw all errors nohm encounters
  nohm.logError = function (err) {
    throw new Error({
      name: "Nohm Error",
      message: err
    });
  }
{% endhighlight %}

**IMPORTANT**: Sadly this is not actually fully true yet. There are a few places where nohm will just throw. TODO!

### Models
You start by defining a Model. A model needs a name and properties and can optionally have custom methods and a redis client.


{% highlight js %}    
var someModel = nohm.model('YourModelName', {
  properties: {
    // ... here you'll define your properties
  },
  methods: { // optional
    // ... here you'll define your custom methods
  },
  client: someRedisClient // optional
});
{% endhighlight %}
<p><small>Strictly speaking the properties are optional as well, but a model really doesn't make sense without them.</small></p>

The first parameter is the name of the model that is used internally by nohm for the redis keys and relations. This should be unique across your application (prefix/db).
The second is an object containing properties, methods and the client.

#### Methods
If you want your model to have custom methods you can define them here. They will be bound to the model and thus inside them the 'this' keyword is the instance of a model.

#### Client
You can optionally set a redis client for a model. This means that you can theoretically store every model on a different redis db. (I don't recommend this at all!)
**Important**: Currently relations between models on different dbs do NOT work! This might get implemented at a later stage if there's any interest for it.

#### Properties
Deinfing the properties is the most important part of a model.  
A property can have the following options: (explained in more detail later)

<dl>
  <dt>
    <b>type</b> <span class="additionalInfo">String/Function</span>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The variable type/behaviour of the property. All values will be cast to this value.<br/>
    There are a few built-in types:<br/>
      <code>string, integer, float, boolean, timestamp and json</code><br/>
    You can also define a behaviour. This is a function that type-casts the value in whatever way you want.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    defaultValue <span class="additionalInfo">Any value</span>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    The default value a property will have when the model is initialized.<br/>
    Can even be a function that will be called each time a new instance is created and the return value will be the value of the property.<br/>

    <b>Note</b>: If you do not define a default value, it will be 0.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    validations <span class="additionalInfo">Array of strings/arrays/functions</span>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    An array of validations for the property. There are a few built-ins but you can define a custom function here as well.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    index <span class="additionalInfo">Boolean</span>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Whether the value should be indexed. This makes finding easier/faster but stores a few bytes more in the redis db.
  </dd>
  <dt>
    unique <span class="additionalInfo">Boolean</span>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Whether the value should be unique among all instances of this model. (case insensitive. empty strings are not counted as unique.)
  </dd>
  <dt>
    load_pure <span class="additionalInfo">Boolean</span>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    Per default this is false and values loaded are put through the type casting/behaviours. If you want to prevent this you can set this to true and it will not be altered from the data that redis delivers.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p><small><bold>bold</bold> = mandatory</small></p>

Here's an example of a very basic user model:

{% highlight js %}
var User = nohm.model('User', {
  properties: {
    name: {
      type: 'string',
      unique: true,
      validations: [
        ['notEmpty']
      ]
    },
    email: {
      type: 'string',
      unique: true,
      validations: [
        ['notEmpty'],
        ['email']
      ]
    },
    password: {
      defaultValue: '',
      type: function (value) {
        return value + 'someSeed'; // and hash it of course, but to make this short that is omitted in this example
      },
      validations: [
        ['length', {
          min: 6
        }]
      ]
    },
    visits: {
      type: 'integer',
      index: true
    }
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

##### Types/Behaviours

###### String
Normal javascript string.

###### Integer / Float
The value is parsed to an Int(base 10) or Float and defaults to 0 if NaN.

###### Boolean
Casts to boolean - except 'false' (string) which will be cast to false (boolean).

###### Timestamp
Converts a Date(-time) to a timestamp (base 10 integer of miliseconds from 1970).
This takes two different formats as inputs:
* Numbers result in a direct parseInt
* ISO string of a date (with timezone)
* any date string 'new Date()' can handle

###### Json
If a valid JSON string is entered nothing is done, anything else will get put through JSON.stringify.
Note that properties with the type of JSON will be returned as parsed objects!

###### Behaviour
This can be any function you want.  
Its `this` keyword is the instance of the model and it receives the arguments new_value, name and old_value.
The return value of the function will be the new value of the property.
Note that the redis client will convert everything to strings before storing!

A simple example:
{% highlight js %} 
var User = nohm.model('User', {
  properties: {
    balance: {
      defaultValue: 0,
      type: function changeBalance(value, key, old) {
        return old + value;
      }
    }
  }
});

var test = new User();
test.p('balance'); // 0
test.p('balance', 5);
test.p('balance'); // 5
test.p('balance', 10);
test.p('balance'); // 15
test.p('balance', -6);
test.p('balance'); // 9
{% endhighlight %}

##### Validators
A property can have multiple validators. These are invoked whenever a model is saved or manually validated.
Validations of a property are defined as an array of strings, objects and functions.

Functions must be asynchronous and accept 3 arguments: new_value, options and callback.
The callback expects one argument: (bool) whether the value is valid or not.
*Note*: Functions included like this cannot be exported to the browser!

Here's an example with all three ways:
{% highlight js %}
var validatorModel = nohm.model('validatorModel', {
  properties: {
    builtIns: {
      type: 'string',
      validations: [
        'notEmpty',
        ['length', {
          max: 20 // 20 will be the second parameter given to the maxLength validator function (the first being the new value)
        }]
      ]
    },
    optionalEmail: {
      type: 'string',
      unique: true,
      validations: [
        ['email', {
          optional: true // every validation supports the optional option
        }]
      ]
    },
    customValidation: {
      type: 'integer',
      validations: [
        function checkIsFour(value, options, callback) {
          callback(value === 4);
        }
      ]
    }
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

You can find the documentation of the [built-in validations in the api](api/symbols/validators.html) or look directly [at the source code](https://github.com/maritz/nohm/blob/master/lib/validators.js).


##### Custom validations in extra files

If you need to define custom validations as functions and want them to be exportable for the browser validations, you need to include them from an external file.

Example customValidation.js:

{% highlight js %}
exports.usernameIsAnton= function (value, options) {
  if (options.revert) {
    callback(value !== 'Anton');
  } else {
    callback(value === 'Anton');
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}


This is then included like this: 

{% highlight js %}
Nohm.setExtraValidations('customValidation.js')
{% endhighlight %}


Now you can use this validation in your model definitions like this:

{% highlight js %}
nohm.model('validatorModel', {
  properties: {
    customValidation: {
      type: 'string',
      validations: [
        'usernameIsAnton',
        // or
        ['usernameIsAnton', {
          revert: true
        }]
      ]
    }
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}


#### ID generation

By default the ids of instances are unique strings and generated at the time of the first save call. You can however either choose an incremental id scheme or provide a custom function for generating ids.

{% highlight js %}
var incremental = nohm.model('incrementalIdModel', {
  properties: {
    name: {
      type: 'string',
      validations: [
        'notEmpty'
      ]
    }
  },
  idGenerator: 'increment'
});
//ids of incremental will be 1, 2, 3 ...

var prefix = 'bob';
var counter = 200;
var step = 50;
var custom = Nohm.model('customIdModel', {
  properties: {
    name: {
      type: 'string',
      defaultValue: 'tom',
      validations: [
        'notEmpty'
      ]
    }
  },
  idGenerator: function (cb) {
    counter += step;
    cb(prefix+counter);
  }
});
// ids of custom will be bob250, bob300, bob350 ...
{% endhighlight %}


### Creating an instance

There are two basic ways to create an instance of a model.


#### Manual

Using the new keyword on the return of Nohm.model.

{% highlight js %}
var UserModel = Nohm.model('UserModel', {});
var user = new UserModel();
{% endhighlight %}

This has the drawback that you need to keep track of your models.


#### Factory

This is the easier and preferred method.

{% highlight js %}
Nohm.model('UserModel', {});
var user = Nohm.factory('UserModel');
{% endhighlight %}

You can also pass an id and callback as the 2nd and 3rd arguments to immediately load the data from db.

{% highlight js %}
Nohm.model('UserModel', {});
var user = Nohm.factory('UserModel', 123, function (err) {
  if (err) {
    // db error or id not found
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}


### Setting/Getting properties

The function p/prop/property (all the same) gets and sets properties of an instance.

{% highlight js %}
var user = new User();
user.p('name', 'test');
user.p('name'); // returns 'test'
user.p({
  name: 'test2',
  email: 'someMail@example.com'
});
user.p('name'); // returns 'test2'
user.p('email'); // returns 'someMail@example.com'
{% endhighlight %}

There are several other methods for dealing with properties: [allProperties](api/symbols/Nohm.html#.allProperties), [propertyReset](api/symbols/Nohm.html#.propertyReset), [propertyDiff](api/symbols/Nohm.html#.propertyDiff)


### Validating

Your model instance is automatically validated on saving but you can manually validate it as well.  
In the following code examples we assume the model of the [valitators section](#validators) is defined and instanced as `user`.

#### Calling valid()

{% highlight js %}
user.p({
  builtIns: 'teststringlongerthan20chars',
  optionalEmail: 'hurgs',
  customValidation: 3
});
user.valid(false, false, function (valid) {
  if ( ! valid) {
    user.errors; // { builtIns: ['length'], optionalEmail: ['email'], customValidation: ['custom'] }
  } else {
    // valid! YEHAA!
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

There are a few things to note here:
* The user errors object contains the errors for each property since the last validation of that property (this is a problem that will be fixed)
* The first argument to valid is an optional property name. If set, only that property will be validated.
* The second argument to valid is to tell the unique check whether it should lock the unique. The unique checks are the last validation and if the model is not valid by the time the uniques are checked, this argument is ignored and no unique is locked. If the unique check of any property results in an error all unique locks that were done in the process of the previous checks are removed (however not the old unique locks of the last valid state).


#### Browser validation

You can also do most validations in the browser by using the nohm-connect-middleware. (except custom validations defined in the model definition)
This is useful if you don't want to do the ajax round trip for every small validation you might have.

{% highlight js %}
Nohm.connect(options);
{% endhighlight %}

Connect takes an argument containing the following options:
 *    `url`         - Url under which the js file will be available. Default: '/nohmValidations.js'
 *    `exclusions`  - Object containing exclusions for the validations export - see example for details
 *    `namespace`   - Namespace to be used by the js file in the browser. Default: 'nohmValidations'
 *    `extraFiles`  - Extra files containing validations. You should only use this if they are not already set via Nohm.setExtraValidations as nohm.connect automatically includes those.
 *    `maxAge`      - Cache control (in seconds)

{% highlight js %}
server.use(nohm.connect(
  // options object
  {
  url: '/nohm.js',
  namespace: 'nohm',
  exclusions: {
    User: { // modelName
      name: [0], // this will ignore the first validation in the validation definition array for name in the model definition
      salt: true // this will completely ignore all validations for the salt property
    },
    Privileges: true // this will completely ignore the Priviledges model
  }
}));
{% endhighlight %}

If you now include /nohm.js (or default /nohmValidations.js) in your page, you can validate any model in the browser like this:


{% highlight js %}
// using defined namespace from above. default would be nohmValidations
nohm.validate('User', {
  name: 'test123',
  email: 'test@test.de',
  password: '\*\*\*\*\*\*'
}, function (valid, errors) {
  if (valid) {
    alert('User is valid!');
  } else {
    alert('Oh no, your user data was not accepted!');
    // errors is the same format as on the server model.errors
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}


### Saving

Saving an instance automatically decides whether it needs to be created or updated on the base of checking for user.id.
This means that if you haven't either manually set the id or load()ed the instance from the database, it will try to create a new instance.
Saving automatically validates the entire instance. If it is not valid, nothing will be saved.

{% highlight js %}
user.save(function (err) {
  if (err) {
    user.errors; // the errors in validation
  } else {
    // it's in the db :)
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

Save can take an optional object containing options, which defaults to this:

{% highlight js %}
user.save({
  silent: false, // if true, no events from this save are published
  continue_on_link_error: false // by default if user was linked to to objects before saving and the first linking fails, the second link will not be saved either. 
                                // set this to true to try saving all relations, regardless of previous linking errors.
}, function (err) {
});
{% endhighlight %}


### Deleting

Calling remove() completely removes the instance from the db, including realtions (but not the related instances - so it is not a cascading remove).
This only works on instances where the id is set (manually or from load()).

{% highlight js %}
var user = nohm.factory('User');
user.id = 123;
user.remove({ // options object can be omitted
  silent: true, // whether remove event is published. defaults to false.
}, function (err) {
  // user is gone.
});
{% endhighlight %}


### Loading

To populate the properties of an existing instance you have to load it via ID.
{% highlight js %}
user.load(1234, function (err, properties) {
  if (err) {
    // err may be a redis error or "not found" if the id was not found in the db.
  } else {
    console.log(properties);
    // you could use this.allProperties() instead, which also gives you the 'id' property
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}


### Finding

To find an ID of an instance (e.g. to load it) Nohm offers a few simple search functionalities.
The function to do so is always .find(), but what it does depends on the arguments given.


#### Finding all ids of a model

Simply calling find() with only a callback will retrieve all IDs.

{% highlight js %}
  SomeModel.find(function (err, ids) {
    // ids = array of ids
  });
{% endhighlight %}


#### Finding by Index

To specify indexes to search for you have to pass in an object as the first parameter.  
There are three kinds of indexes: unique, simple and numeric.  
Unique is the fastest and if you look for a property that is unqiue all other search criterias are ignored.  
You can mix the three search queries within one find call.  
After all search queries of a find() have been processed the intersection of the found IDs is returned.  
To limit/filter/sort the overall result you have to manually edit the returned array.


##### Finding by simple index

Simple indexes are created for all properties that have `index` set to true and are of the type 'string', 'boolean', 'json' or custom (behaviour).

Example:
{% highlight js %}
SomeModel.find({
    someString: 'hurg'
    someBoolean: false
  }, function (err, ids) {
    // ids = array of all instances that have (somestring === 'hurg' && someBoolean === false)
  });
{% endhighlight %}


##### Finding by numeric index

Numeric indexes are created for all properties that have `index` set to true and are of the type 'integer', 'float' or 'timestamp'.  
The search needs to be an object that optionaly contains further filters: min, max, offset and limit.  
This uses the redis command [zrangebyscore](http://redis.io/commands/zrangebyscore) and the filters are the same as the arguments passed to that command. (limit = count)  
They default to this:
{% highlight js %}
{
  min: '-inf',
  max: '+inf',
  offset: '+inf', // only used if a limit is defined
  limit: undefined
}
{% endhighlight %}

To specify an infinite limit while using an offset use limit: 0.

Example:
{% highlight js %}
SomeModel.find({
    someInteger: {
      min: 10,
      max: 40,
      offset: 15, // this in combination with the limit would work as a kind of pagination where only five results are returned, starting from result 15
      limit: 5
    },
    SomeTimestamp: {
      max: + new Date() // timestamp before now
    }
  }, function (err, ids) {
    
  });
{% endhighlight %}

**Important**: The limit is only specific to the index you are searching for. In this example it will limit the someInteger search to 5 results, but the someTimestamp search is unlimited. Since the overall result will be an intersection of all searches, there can only be as many ids as the limit of the smallest search has. 

If you limit multiple searches you might also end up with 0 results even though each search resulted in more ids because there may be no intersection.

It is simpler and recommended to either only limit one search or manually limit the result array in the callback.

You can also search for exact numeric values by using the syntax of a simple index search.


### Sorting

You can sort your models in a few basic ways with the build-in .sort() method.
However it might be a good idea to do more complex sorts manually.

#### Sort all from DB


{% highlight js %}
SomeModel.sort({ // options object
  field: 'name' // field is mandatory
}, function (err, ids) {
  // ids is an array of the first 100 ids of SomeModel instances in the db, sorted alphabetically ascending by name
});

SomeModel.sort({
  field: 'name',
  direction: 'DESC'
}, function (err, ids) {
  // ids is an array of the first 100 ids of SomeModel instances in the db, sorted alphabetically descending by name
});

SomeModel.sort({
  field: 'name',
  direction: 'DESC',
  start: 50
}, function (err, ids) {
  // ids is an array of 100 ids of SomeModel instances in the db, sorted alphabetically descending by name - starting at the 50th
});

SomeModel.sort({
  field: 'name',
  direction: 'DESC',
  start: 50,
  amount: 50
}, function (err, ids) {
  // ids is an array of 50 ids of SomeModel instances in the db, sorted alphabetically descending by name - starting at the 50th
});


// this
SomeModel.sort({
  field: 'last_edit',
  start: -10,
  amount: 10
}, function (err, ids) {
  // ids is an array of the 10 last edited instances in the model (provided last_edit is filled properly on edit)
});
// would have the same result as:
SomeModel.sort({
  field: 'last_edit',
  direction: 'DESC',
  start: 0,
  amount: 10
}, function (err, ids) {
  // ids is an array of the 10 last edited instances in the model (provided last_edit is filled properly on edit)
});
{% endhighlight %}


#### Sort a subset by given IDs

If you have an array of IDs and want them in a sorted order, you can use the same method with the same options but giving the array as the second argument. This is especially useful if combined with find().

{% highlight js %}
// assuming car model
Car.find({
  manufacturer: 'ferrari',
}, function (err, ferrari_ids) {
  Car.sort({
      field: 'build_year'
    },
    ferrari_ids, // array of found ferrari car ids
    function (err, sorted_ids) {
      // sorted_ids =  max. 100 oldest ferrari cars
    }
  );
});
{% endhighlight %}

*Note*; If performance is very important it might be a good idea to do this kind of find/sort combination yourself in a multi query to the redis DB.


### Relations

Relations (links) are dynamically defined for each instance and not for a model. This differs from traditional ORMs that use RDBMS and thus need a predefined set of tables or columns to maintain these relations.  
In nohm this is not necessary making it possible for one instance of a model to have relations to models that other instances of the same model do not have.

A simple example:  
We have 2 instances of the UserModel: User1, User2  
We have 3 instances the RoleModel: AdminRole, AuthorRole, UserManagerRole
A user can have 0-3 roles.  
This creates an N:M relationship. In a traditional DB you'd now need a [pivot table](http://www.wellho.net/solutions/mysql-many-to-many-table-mapping-pivot-tables.html) and then you'd have to somehow tell your ORM that it should use that table to map these relations.  
In nohm this step is not needed.  
Instead we just tell every UserModel instance whatever relationships it has.  

This has the upside of more flexibility in relations, but the downside of more complexity maintaining these relations.  

In nohm all relations have a name pair. By default this pair is "default" and "defaultForeign". The instance that initiated the relationship is the "default" the one that is linked to it is the "defaultForeign" ("Foreign" is attached to custom link names for this).  
This again has the upside of more flexibility in relations, but the downside of more complexity maintaining these relations. 

Some Examples:


{% highlight js %}
User1.link(AdminRole);
User1.link(AuthorRole);
User2.link(UserManagerRole, 'createdBy');
User2.link(UserManagerRole, 'temp');
{% endhighlight %}

Now (after saving) these relations exist:
* User1 (default) -> AdminRole (defaultForeign)
* User1 (default) -> AuthorRole (defaultForeign)
* User1 (createdBy) -> UserManagerRole (createdByForeign)
* User2 (temp) -> UserManagerRole (tempForeign)

Tip: Be careful with naming and don't overuse it!


#### link(otherInstance, \[options,\] \[callback\])

This creates a relation (link) to another instance.
The most basic usage is to just use the first argument:

{% highlight js %}
User1.link(AdminRole);
{% endhighlight %}

The relation is only written to the DB when User1 is saved. (not when saving Admin!)

{% highlight js %}
var User = nohm.factory('User');
User.link(AdminRole);
User.save(function (err, is_link_error, link_error_model_name) {
  if ( ! err) {
    // User1 and Admin are saved
  } else {
    // an error occured while saving.
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

There are several things that happen here:  
First User1 is validated. If User1 is invalid the save callback is called with the error.  
If User1 is valid, User1 is stored.  
If Admin has an ID, the relation is stored and the save callback is called.  
Otherwise Admin is validated. If Admin is invalid an optional error callback is called and execution returns to the save of User. (arguments to the save callback would be 'invalid', true, Admin.modelName)
If Admin is valid, Admin is stored, the relation is stored and the save callback is called.


This process works infinitely deep. However this process is not atomic, thus it might be a better idea to save the elements individually and then link them!


link can take an optional options object or link name as the second argument. If it is a string, it's assumed to be the link name.
The options object has 2 available options:

{% highlight js %}
User1.link(ManagerRole, {
  name: 'hasRole', // otherwise defaults to "default"
  error: function (error_mesage, validation_errors, object) {
    // this is called if there was an error while saving the linked object (ManagerRole in this case)
    // error_message is the error ManagerRole.save() reported
    // validation_errors is ManagerRole.errors
    // object is ManagerRole
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}


#### unlink(otherInstance, \[options,\] \[callback\])

Removes the relation to another instance and otherwise works the same as link.


#### has(otherInstance, \[relationName,\] \[callback\])

This checks if an instance has a relationship to another relationship.

{% highlight js %}
User1.has(Admin, function (err, hasAdmin) {
  if (hasAdmin) {
    // the user has the admin role!
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

This requires that User1 as well as Admin are loaded from DB. (Or saved on the variable holding the instance)


#### numLinks(modelName, \[relationName,\] \[callback\])

This checks how many relations of one name pair an Instance has to another Model.

{% highlight js %}
// assuming the relation definitions from above

User1.numLinks('RoleModel', function (err, num) {
  // num will be 2
  // note that it is not 3, because the default link name is used
});

// get the amount of links that are named 'createdBy':
User1.numLinks('RoleModel', 'createdBy', function (err, num) {
  // num will be 1
});

// get the amount of links that are named 'temp':
User1.numLinks('RoleModel', 'temp', function (err, num) {
  // num will be 0
});
{% endhighlight %}


#### getAll(modelName, \[relationName,\] \[callback\])

This gets the IDs of all linked instances.

{% highlight js %}
User1.getAll('RoleModel', function (err, roleIds) {
  // roleIds = [1,2]
});

User1.getAll('RoleModel', 'createdBy', function (err, roleIds) {
  // roleIds = [3]
});

User2.getAll('RoleModel', 'temp', function (err, roleIds) {
  // roleIds = [3]
});
{% endhighlight %}


### Publish / Subscribe

Nohm supports a way for seperate clients to get notified of nohm actions in other clients, if they are connected to the same redis database and PubSub is activated.


#### Configuration

To use PubSub 2 steps are required:

1. setting a seperate redis client for subscribing
2. configuring either nohm or models to publish

##### Setting the second redis client

{% highlight js %}
var secondClient = require('redis').createClient();
nohm.setPubSubClient(secondClient, function (err) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Error while initializing the second redis client');
  } else {
    // Yey, we can start subscribing :)  
    
    // to close the pubsub connection and make the redis client available for normal commands again:
    nohm.closePubSub(function (err, client) {
      // client == secondClient
      // nohm will still publish though
    });
  }
});
{% endhighlight %}

##### Configuring nohm globally to publish

{% highlight js %}
nohm.setPublish(true); // this client will publish on all models
nohm.setPublish(false); // this client will only publish on models that are configured to publish themselves
{% endhighlight %}

##### Configuring models to publish

{% highlight js %}
// This model will publish no matter what the global publish setting is.
nohm.model('Publish', {
  properties: {},
  publish: true
}):

// This model will only publish if the global setting is set to true.
nohm.model('No_publish', {
  properties: {}
});
{% endhighlight %}

#### Checking if a model is set to publish

{% highlight js %}
nohm.factory('someModelName').getPublish(); // returns whether the model someModelName will publish
{% endhighlight %}

#### Usage

There are 6 events that get published: 

* 'create'   -- a new instance is getting created.
* 'update'   -- an instance is getting updated with new values.
* 'save'     -- an instance is getting created OR updated (in addition to one of the above).
* 'remove'   -- an instance is getting removed (although you get an id here, the data is not in the db anymore)
* 'link'     -- instances are getting linked
* 'unlink'   -- instances are getting unlinked

All\* these event callbacks get an object containing these properties:

{% highlight js %}
{
  target: {
    id: 'id_of_the_instance',
    modelName: 'name_of_the_model',
    properties: {} // instance.allProperties() from where the event was fired
    
    // only in save/update:
    diff: {} // instance.propertyDiff()
  }
}
{% endhighlight %}

\*The Exceptions are link and unlink:

{% highlight js %}
{
  child: {
    id: 'id_of_the_child_instance',
    modelName: 'name_of_the_child_model',
    properties: {} // child.allProperties() from where the event was fired
  },
  parent: {
    id: 'id_of_the_parent_instance',
    modelName: 'name_of_the_parent_model',
    properties: {} // parent.allProperties() from where the event was fired
  },
  relation: 'child' // relation name
}
{% endhighlight %}


To handle subscribing to these events there are 3 functions to use: model.subscribe, model.subscribeOnce and model.unsubscribe.


##### model.subscribe

Subscribe to all actions of a specified event type on a model.

Example:

{% highlight js %}
nohm.factory('someModel').subscribe('update', function (event) {
  console.log('someModel with id'+event.target.id+' was updated and now looks like this:', event.target.properties);
});
{% endhighlight %}


##### model.subscribeOnce

Subscribe and after it is fired once, unsubcsribe.

Example:

{% highlight js %}
var updates = 0;
nohm.factory('someModel').subscribeOnce('update', function (event) {
  // will only be called once no matter how many updates happen after 1 has published
  updates++;
  console.log('someModel with id'+event.target.id+' was updated and now looks like this:', event.target.properties);
  console.log(updates);
});
{% endhighlight %}


##### model.unsubscribe

Unsubscribe one or all listeners.

Example:

{% highlight js %}
var model = nohm.factory('someModel');
var callback = function (event) {
  console.log('someModel with id'+event.target.id+' was updated and now looks like this:', event.target.properties);
};
model.subscribe('update', callback);

// to unsubscribe only one:
model.unsubscribe('update', callback);

// or unsubscribe all
model.unsubscribe('update');
{% endhighlight %}


### Extras

Some things that don't really fit anywhere else in this documentation.


#### Short Forms

For some functions there are short forms.

Instead of having to do something like:
{% highlight js %}
  var user = new User();
  user.load(1, function () {
    user.p('name', 'test');
  });
{% endhighlight %}

You can do this:

{% highlight js %}
  User.load(1, function () {
    this.p('name', 'test');
  });
{% endhighlight %}

This currently works for the following functions: load, find, save and remove.
It is really only a shortcut.
